"Predict salaries using data analysis and machine learning. Web app for quick predictions. Ideal for learning and customization."

"**Salary Prediction Data Science Project**

This GitHub repository houses a data science project that focuses on predicting salary based on several key features such as age, years of experience, education level, and gender. The project includes the following components:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between features and salary.

2. **Machine Learning Model**: Develop and train a linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict salaries based on input features.

3. **Flask Web Application**: Create a Flask web application that allows users to input their information and get a salary prediction using the trained model.

4. **Data**: The project includes sample data in 'Salary Data.csv' and a pre-trained model in 'sal_model.sav.'

This project is designed to showcase data analysis, machine learning, and web development skills, making it a useful resource for learning and implementing similar data science projects. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this project as a template for your own salary prediction projects."
